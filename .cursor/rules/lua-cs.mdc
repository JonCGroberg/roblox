- All variables and functions must be declared with `local`.
- Modules must follow the `return table` pattern.
- Lines must not exceed 80 characters.
- No use of undeclared globals (strict mode required on each file).
- Use Single-Script Architecture with ModuleScripts for each system
- Pass shared tables (Shared/Modules) via Init functions to decouple dependencies
- Follow strict module pattern with local declarations and return tables
- Maintain clear separation between client and server modules
